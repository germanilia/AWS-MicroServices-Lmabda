## Create an IAM Role to Use for Jenkins Integration
As a best practice, consider launching an Amazon EC2 instance to host your Jenkins server and using an IAM role to grant the instance the required permissions for interacting with CodePipeline.
- Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.
- In the IAM console, in the navigation pane, choose **Roles**, and then choose **Create new role**.
- On the **Select role type** page, with **AWS Service Role** selected, next to **Amazon EC2**, choose **Select**.
- On the **Attach Policy** page, select the **AWSCodePipelineFullAccess** managed policy, and then choose **Next Step**.
- On the **Set role name and review** page, in the **Role name** box, type the name of the role you will create specifically for Jenkins integration (for example <span style="color:red">*JenkinsAccess*</span>), and then choose **Create role**.

## Attach Role To Jenkins EC2 Instance
In order to set the correct permissions to Jenkins master in the most secure way, 
We need to attach the Role created in the previouse stage to the EC2 instance running Jenkins master.
- Sign in to thw AWS Ec2 Console at https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home
- Select the instance running Jenkins master, Click on **Actions** > **Instance State** > **Stop**
- Now select **Image Settings** > **Attach/Replace IAM Role** & **select the role created in previous section** > **Apply**
