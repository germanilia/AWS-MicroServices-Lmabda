## CodeStar Overview

AWS CodeStar is a cloud-based service for creating, managing, and working with software development projects on AWS. You can quickly develop, build, and deploy<br/> applications on AWS with an AWS CodeStar project. An AWS CodeStar project creates and integrates AWS services for your project development toolchain. Depending on<br/> your choice of AWS CodeStar project template, that toolchain might include source control, build, deployment, virtual servers or serverless resources, and more.<br/>

Please use **Ireland** region for the following steps

**Create a CodeStar project**

- In the AWS Management Console choose Services then select CodeStar under Developer Tools.

- You will be prompted to confirm that you are granting CodeStar permission to create other AWS resources on your behalf, such as CodeCommit repositories, CodePipeline pipelines, and CodeBuild projects. Click **Yes, create role** to proceed.<br/>

- To narrow the choices for CodeStar projects, select Web service, Node.js, and AWS Lambda in the left navigation. This should narrow the project options to the Express.js web service project, using AWS Lambda. Select this box to proceed.

- The screen below is your CodeStar project dashboard. After creating a new project, there will be a short delay as CodeStar provisions the resources for CodeCommit,<br/> CodeBuild, CodePipeline, and additional resources related to your project template, Lambda functions in this case. When the progress bar in the upper right of<br/> the browser window reaches 100% complete, the provisioning phase of project creation is complete.<br/>

- Once provisioning is complete, there will be a brief delay as the CodePipeline pipeline executes for the first time. The pipeline consists of three stages:<br/>
  - Source stage: source code is copied from the CodeCommit repository
  - Build stage: a CodeBuild project executes the commands defined in the project's buildspec.yml to compile the source code into a deployable artifact, in this case a Serverless Application Model (SAM) artifact.
  - Deploy stage: CloudFormation is used to deploy the SAM artifact, representing Lambda functions and an API Gateway environment.<br/>
When these stages are complete, an API Gateway **Application endpoint** will appear in the dashboard.

- Open the Application endpoint in a browser window and confirm the response message to read
```
{"Output":"Hello World!"}
```
