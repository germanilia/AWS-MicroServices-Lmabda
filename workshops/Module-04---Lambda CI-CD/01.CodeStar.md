**Create a CodeStar project**

- The screen below is your CodeStar project dashboard. After creating a new project, there will be a short delay as CodeStar provisions the resources for CodeCommit,<br/> CodeBuild, CodePipeline, and additional resources related to your project template, Lambda functions in this case. When the progress bar in the upper right of<br/> the browser window reaches 100% complete, the provisioning phase of project creation is complete.<br/>

- Once provisioning is complete, there will be a brief delay as the CodePipeline pipeline executes for the first time. The pipeline consists of three stages:<br/>
  - Source stage: source code is copied from the CodeCommit repository
  - Build stage: a CodeBuild project executes the commands defined in the project's buildspec.yml to compile the source code into a deployable artifact, in this case a Serverless Application Model (SAM) artifact.
  - Deploy stage: CloudFormation is used to deploy the SAM artifact, representing Lambda functions and an API Gateway environment.<br/>
When these stages are complete, an API Gateway **Application endpoint** will appear in the dashboard.
