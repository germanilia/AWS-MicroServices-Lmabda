## Intro

In this workshop you'll deploy a RESTful API that enables users to manage the Wild Rydes Unicorn Stable. You will use the Serverless Application Model (SAM) to deploy<br/> the API interfaces, business logic, and database into your AWS account. The RESTful API will allow a user to list, create, view, update, and delete the<br/> unicorns in the Wild Rydes stable.<br/>
<br/>
The application architecture uses AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, and Amazon DynamoDB. The API is built using Lambda and API Gateway, using DynamoDB as a persistent <br/>data store for unicorn data.<br/>
<br/>
See the diagram below for a depiction of the API architecture.<br/>

 The DevOps Continuous Delivery Pipeline uses AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, and Amazon S3. CodePipeline orchestrates the steps to build, test, and deploy your code changes. CodeBuild compiles source code, runs tests, and produces software packages that are ready to deploy to environments.
