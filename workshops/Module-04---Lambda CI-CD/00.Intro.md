## Intro

In this workshop you'll deploy a RESTful API that enables users to manage the Wild Rydes Unicorn Stable. You will use the Serverless Application Model (SAM) to deploy<br/> the API interfaces, business logic, and database into your AWS account. The RESTful API will allow a user to list, create, view, update, and delete the<br/> unicorns in the Wild Rydes stable.<br/>
<br/>
The application architecture uses AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, and Amazon DynamoDB. The API is built using Lambda and API Gateway, using DynamoDB as a persistent <br/>data store for unicorn data.<br/>
<br/>
See the diagram below for a depiction of the API architecture.<br/>
